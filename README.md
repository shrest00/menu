I started by setting up a Bootstrap-enabled HTML page using the CDN method. I added a responsive heading using display-4 and fw-bold to give it impact across devices. The main content is inside a Bootstrap container to keep the layout responsive and centered.

I used two rows. The first row contains two col-md-6 columns so the appetizer and drink are side-by-side on medium and larger screens, and stacked on smaller screens. For the second row, I used three col-lg-4 columns, which display side-by-side on large screens and stack on smaller ones, showing varied layouts at two breakpoints (md and lg).

Images use the img-fluid class so they scale properly and stay within their columns. Text and spacing are handled with Bootstrap utility classes like mt-2, mb-4, and py-4.

All of this allows the layout to be responsive without custom CSS. The result is a clean, mobile-friendly brunch menu that adapts gracefully to different screen sizes.
